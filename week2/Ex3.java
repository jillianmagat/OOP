/* Exercise 1.3	Write a Java program to calculate the area of a circle. Recall that the area of circle is given by
Area = (pi)*radius*radius (i.e. pi * rÂ²). Try it with several different values for the radius and use 3.14 for pi.
Hint : To calculate square use Java method Math.pow(i, 2), which is equivalent of i2; */
